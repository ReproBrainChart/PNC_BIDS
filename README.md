## PNC RBC README
This is the neuroimaging dataset for the [Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915002529).
PNC is a large-scale study of child development that combines neuroimaging, diverse clinical and cognitive phenotypes, and genomics. 
Data from this rich resource is now publicly available through the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The Philadelphia 
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) is a research initiative funded by NIMH through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (ARRA). 
The initiative focuses on characterizing brain and behavior interaction with genetics. This is a collaborative research effort between the 
Brain Behavior Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania and the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 
led by Raquel E. Gur, MD, PhD at the University of Pennsylvania and Hakon Hakonarson, MD, PhD at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

This version of the dataset was curated at the University of Pennsylvania by the Lifespan Informatics 
and Neuroimaging Center (PennLINC) as part of the "Reproducible Brain Chart" (RBC) Initiative. RBC seeks to aggregate, 
organize QA, process, curate, and openly disseminate many of the largest cross-sectional studies of brain development.
